# Text Grab

Copy the text from anything on your screen - a PDF, a video frame, a website that blocks
copying, a photo of the whiteboard - and read QR codes. Works offline; reads Hungarian,
English and German.

## Install

```bash
cd text-grab
./install.sh
```

It installs Tesseract (the text recognition, with Hungarian, English and German) and the
QR reader if they are missing (it asks for your password once), and starts with your
computer. Running it again updates it.

## Use

1. Press **Ctrl+Alt+G**. The screen freezes and gets darker.
2. Drag a box around the text (or QR code). **Esc** or right-click cancels.
3. The text is **in your clipboard** - paste it anywhere with Ctrl+V.

As soon as you let go of the mouse, a small popup (same look as Drop Shelf) appears in the
bottom-right corner with "Reading the text...", then the text itself. The first
lines fade out into the background, like the queue in Now Playing. It fades away after
10 seconds, or stays while your mouse is on it. Click the text (or **Show all**) for the full text.

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| note icon | put the text on a Quick Notes post-it |
| dotted box | grab again |
| copy icon (big window) | copy the text again, with your edits |
| menu (big window) | **Reading order** (normal text, columns one after the other) or **Keep rows** (tables and lists keep their spacing) - it reads the picture again; open the picture |
| header | drag it to move the window |
| ◢ corner | resize the big window |
| Esc / x | close |

**QR codes**: grab one and its content (usually a link) is copied; the open icon opens the link in **Chrome** (put `browser=default` under `[text-grab]` in
`~/.config/text-grab/settings.ini` to use the system default browser instead).

**Images**: right-click a picture in the file manager > **Grab text from image**.

Show the last result again: `text-grab --last`.

## Tips

- Grab only what you need; the tighter the box, the better the result.
- Very small text reads better if you zoom in first (Ctrl + in the browser / PDF viewer).
- Light text on a dark background (dark mode, subtitles) is handled automatically.

## Settings

`~/.config/text-grab/settings.ini`:

```ini
[text-grab]
shortcut=<Primary><Alt>g
languages=hun+eng+deu
```

Other languages: install `tesseract-ocr-fra` (French) etc. and add `+fra`.

Uninstall with `./uninstall.sh`.
